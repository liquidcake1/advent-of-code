Music: None this
Deadline/target: CHRISTMAS
I'm doing each day in a different programming language. https://github.com/liquidcake1/advent-of-code
Plan:
* Improve with new keyboard (Kinesis Advantage 360).
* Final run: C++ (I know it enough to write the template without reference)
* Maybe actually think about the problem??
