Music: Diverse System - Stream Palette series
Deadline: 21:00 (soft)
Plan:
* Struggle with new keyboard?
* Use Elixir.
* Maybe actually think about the problem??

Flood fill. Either:
* - Start in top left, explore surroundings, expand regions, merge when adjacent to same letter, stop when full (ie. squares explored = grid size), sum price over fields, or
* - Fully flood fill each region, walk from top left to bottom right when we hit unexplored regions, or
* Explore right only, merge adjacent regions, transpose, repeat, done.
