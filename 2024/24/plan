Music: None this time...
Deadline/target: CHRISTMAS
I'm doing each day in a different programming language. https://github.com/liquidcake1/advent-of-code
Plan:
* Improve with new keyboard (Kinesis Advantage 360).
* Functional mode: Haskell on this one.
* Maybe actually think about the problem??

Half-adder:

Stage 0=0a?:
x0 XOR y0 -> output_stage0=z0
x0 AND y0 -> carry_stage0a=carry_stage0
Stage 1a:
x1 XOR y1 -> output_stage1a
x1 AND y1 -> carry_stage1a
Stage 1b:
carry_stage0 XOR output_stage1a -> output_stage1=z1
carry_stage0 AND output_stage1a -> carry_stage1b
carry_stage1a OR carry_stage1b -> carry_stage1
