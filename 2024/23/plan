Music: Diverse System - Stream Palette series
Deadline/target: 16:00?
I'm doing each day in a different programming language. https://github.com/liquidcake1/advent-of-code
Plan:
* Improve with new keyboard (Kinesis Advantage 360).
* All Your Guarantees: Zig, today (suggested by Rokannon)
* Maybe actually think about the problem??

Technique:
0. Remove one element from the graph.
1. Start with target network size n=7.
2. Remove anything with fewer than n-1 connections from the graph.
3. Recompute the connections.
4. If no connections were removed, output the graph and go to 6. Hope: Graph is of size n.
5. If there are more than n things, go to 2.
6. Reduce n and repeat unless n < 4.
7. Go to 0.
